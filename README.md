# Travel Destination Generator

#### View Live Application: https://travel-destination-generator.netlify.app/ 

### Overview
Application generates a random destination with a brief country description and links the user to the Google Flights page for the generated destination.

### Purpose of Project
I wanted to create a site/application that would expose people to a diverse array of potential travel destinations that they may not have considered in the past. I think the application would appeal to people who have not traveled very much and are unsure of where to go, and to people who have traveled many places and are looking to choose a destination spontaneously. This type of application could be featured on a travel company, airline, or study abroad organization website.

I also wanted to create a project that would use arrays, random generation, and the setTimeOut() function, as those were JavaScript skills that I wanted to practice.
